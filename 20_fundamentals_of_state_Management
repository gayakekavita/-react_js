--We use  useState() function to create state in react.
--State Management:: 
      Deciding when to create pieces of state , what types of state are necessary , where to place each piece of state and how data flows through the app.

-- Types of state
   1.Global state
         - State that might need by many components
         - Shared state is accessible by every component in the entire application.
   2.local state 
         - Local state is  a state needed by one or few components.
         -State that is defined in a component and only that component and child component have access to it.(by passing via props)


--When and where to place the state::
     1. Need to store data  
         -- Will data change at some point ?
               1. If yes:
                         Can be coputed from existing state/props?
                               1. if No 
                                     Should it re-render the component ?

                                              Place a new piece of state in component
                                                     -- Only used by this component ?
                                                         1. If yes ::

                                                              Also used by child component ?
                                                                 1. YEs

                                                                        1. If yes::
                                                                              Lift state up to first common parent 
                                           2. No
                                                  Ref(useRef)
