The main difference between React.js and vanilla JavaScript can be summarized as follows:

1. **React.js**: React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture where UIs are composed of independent, reusable components. React simplifies the process of updating and rendering UI elements efficiently by utilizing a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) and employing a one-way data flow.

2. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript refers to using plain, standard JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks. When building web applications with vanilla JavaScript, developers have complete control over the code and can directly manipulate the DOM to create and update UI elements. However, without the abstractions and optimizations provided by libraries like React.js, managing complex UIs and state can become more challenging and prone to inefficiencies.

In essence, React.js abstracts away many of the complexities of directly manipulating the DOM and provides a more structured and efficient way to build interactive web applications compared to vanilla JavaScript.
